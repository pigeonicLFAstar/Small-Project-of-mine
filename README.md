# Small-Project-of-mine
This is for arch ONLY, yes the script is trash but im proud of my creation(beginner at scripting lol)
I will add some things in the script that will move the "ez" file to your /usr/bin/(you should alr know what it does)
# BUT IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT /USR/BIN IS?!?!?!
/usr/bin is a directory that you can add scripts(example if you created a file named h and make it exec(chmod +x h) then move the file h to /usr/bin, you can run the script globally))
What is this script you might ask?
# WELL ITS AN EZ ARCH LINUX(like installing, uninstalling, updating and such)
But more will be added LATERRRR!!!
But i need more ideas to what to implement next idk.
# DOWNSIDES OF THIS TRASH AHH SCRIPT!?!?!?
Alot, SERIOUSLY, but will be improved(biggest lie ive told in my life, MAYBE if i have the time)
Chmod +x the script yourself, or it may be alr, tch, idk?!
bare-bones looking ahh script :skull: :skull: :pray:
# BUT IF YOUR USING THE SCRIPT... PLEASEEEEEEEE RUN THIS COMMAND: sudo mv ez /usr/bin/ez
